      <h2><center>Buginese</center></h2>
      <p> The Bugis are a tribe of the Deutero Malay people. It entered the archipelago after the first wave of migration from mainland Asia, precisely Yunan. The name Bugis comes from the word To Ugi which means Bugis. "Ugi" refers to the first king of the Kingdom of China in Pammana, Wajo County. The king was named La Sattumpugi. King La Sattumpugi had a descendant named La Galigo. He is a writer with major literary works in the world, numbering over 9,000 pages. Notable works include Sawerigading Opunna Ware, meaning Yang Dertuan in Ware. This work is about the traditions of Bugis.

The oldest kingdom in South Sulawesi is the Kingdom of Luwu. It originated from other kingdoms in South Sulawesi that later became major kingdoms, such as Bone Kingdom and Gowa Kingdom. In addition to these two major kingdoms, there were also the Kingdom of Mandar, Rappang, Sidenreng, Wajo, and Soppeng. The ancient Bugis used two ways of communicating, orally with the Bugis language, and through writing using the Lontara script. The Bugis language consists of a variety of dialects, such as Bone dialect, Pangkep dialect, Makassar dialect, Pare-Pare dialect, Wajo dialect, Sidenreng Rappang dialect, Sopeng dialect, Sinjai dialect, Pinrang dialect, Malimpung dialect, Dentong dialect, Patinjo dialect, Kallang dialect, Kalli dialect, Kallang dialect, Malimang dialect. The Buol Pamoyagon dialect (Bugis Pomayagon), Buol Bokat dialect (Bugis Bokat), Jambi dialect, South Kalimantan dialect, Lampung dialect, Southeast Sulawesi dialect, Bali dialect, Central Sulawesi dialect, Riau dialect and East Kalimantan dialect.

While in writing, earlier bugis used lontara. Akasa lontara is a manuscript written with a sharp instrument on the lontar leaf and then with black liquid on the scratch. </p>
      <p> The Lontara script appears in some ancient Bugis manuscripts. The journal also describes some ancient manuscripts that became part of the Bugis culture. Lontara Padang: a collection of wise men's commissions that became a rule in the lives of Bugis. Attoriolong: a chronicle of the descendants of kings with past experience. Pau-pauri kadong: folklore with brilliant legends and extraordinary events. In South Sulawesi there are also two types of letters that have been used. First, quadrilateral letters or alphabetic characters. Second, the letters of the birds or the letters of the gods.
      Today the majority of Bugis are Muslim (about 99%). The Islamization of the Bugis community has been strongly rooted, although there are still a small number of people who adhere to the Bugis indigenous religion, namely the Tolotang religion, which is about 27 thousand people and lives in the Sidenreng Rappang area. Previously, Bugis people who still adhere to the Tolotang religion had also experienced a tragic fate. They were chased by Darul Islam/Indonesian Islamic Army (DI/TII) rebels led by Kahar Muzakkar. The rebels forced many Tolotang believers to break out of their faith. Not a few Tolotang people were killed.
      Before the Islamicization of Bugis, there had been some 16th-century Christian communities brought by the Portuguese. Currently there are still Christian communities in the Soppeng area but only about 5,000 people. In the 17th century, the spread of Islam brought by preachers from the Malay and Minangkabau lands made many Christians and Tolotang convert to Islam and spread widely in the lands of Bugis and Makassar.

      <p>Since ancient times, the Bugis in South Sulawesi have been known as excellent sailors. They are highly skilled in navigating the vast ocean and ocean to various regions of the archipelago by boat Pinisi.

The Pinisi boat is a traditional marine transportation device of Bugis people that has been famous for centuries. According to the story in the manuscript of Lontarak I Babad La Lagaligo, the Pinisi Boat already existed around the 14th century AD. According to the manuscript, the Pinisi Boat was first made by Sawerigading, Crown Prince of Luwu Kingdom. The material for making the boat is taken from a well - known, highly compact and not easily fragile tree. However, before the tree was cut down, a special ceremony was held to allow the rider to move to another tree. Sawerigading made the boat to sail to China to marry the Chinese princess We Cudai.</p>
      <p>In Bugis culture there are three things that can give an idea of Bugis culture: the concept of ade, pyre pesse, and the symbolism of Bugis are silk gloves.

Ade which in Indonesian is a custom. According to Lontara Bugis, there are five basic principles of ade, namely ade, speech, rapang, wari, and sara. This concept is better known as a dredgee. Ade is a manifestation of a flexible attitude towards different types of regulations in society. Rapang refers more to a model of good conduct that should be followed by society. While wari is the rule regarding the descendants and hierarchies of Sara society, namely the rule of Islamic law. Siri provides firm principles for buggy conduct.

The meaning of "siri" in Bugis society is so meaningful that there is a bugis saying "Siri Paranreng, PLAO LIFE", which means: "If self-esteem is torn apart, then life is paid". So high is the meaning of this Siri to the Bugis community, The loss of one's self-esteem can only be repaid for the cost of one's life by the opposite party even though it is.</p>
